## Git and GitHub
---
I have read about Git before, but I have never tried running it in Terminal or for my projects, so the actual hands-on experience was new.

I was surprised that Git can be a safety net and a trap at the same time - you can use it to explore, to fix bugs, to time travel basically, but it also benevolently allows you to lose your progress with some "push --force", as if confirming "Yes, you can take this ride... to misery".


## Unix Shell

![Linux Survival completed](task_unix_shell/Module4.png)

My previous experience with CLI was limited to basic commands (i.e. Modules 1-2 of Linux Survival), so almost anything beyond that point was new to me. 

I found that expansions (especially brace expansions) were surprisingly fun. Another element of surprise (okay, not that surprising) was that I need to adopt better directory naming practices, since it took me a fair amount of attempts to effectively move files between directories, with most of my attempts ending up with "No such file or directory".

I was particularly interested in redirection commands and want to use them asap.
