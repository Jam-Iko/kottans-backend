**1. Git and GitHub**
---
I have read about Git before, but I have never tried running it in Terminal or for my projects, so the actual hands-on experience was new.

I was surprised that Git can be a safety net and a trap at the same time - you can use it to explore, to fix bugs, to time travel basically, but it also benevolently allows you to lose your progress with some "push --force", as if confirming "Yes, you can take this ride... to misery".
